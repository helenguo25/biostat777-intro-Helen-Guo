# Women in the workforce

## Question(s)

What is the evolution of the gender wage gap over time? How does variation in age and part-time work contribute to the gender wage gap? This exploration is inspired by news of the recent Nobel Prize award-winning work of Claudia Goldin.

## Audience

The intended audience members for this example data analysis are my fellow students in BSPH140.777: Statistical Programming Paradigms and Workflows. This work is a quick exploration that I hope will peak the interest of other curious students.

## Data and data dictionaries

I will be using the earnings_female.csv and employed_gender.csv data sets from the 2019 TidyTuesday github repo for 'Women in the Workforce' [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-03-05). I chose not to use jobs_gender.csv since it only contains information from three years. The two data sets, earnings_female.csv and employed_gender.csv, include female percent of male salary by age group and percent of women/men working full-time/part-time from 1979 to 2011. The data originates from the Bureau of Labor and Census Bureau.

See data dictionaries [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-03-05).

## Analysis

Download data:
```{r}
#| label: "setup"
# Load libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Read in data
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load("2019-03-05")
earnings_female <- tuesdata$earnings_female
employed_gender <- tuesdata$employed_gender
```

Clean/wrangle data:
```{r}
# Rename 'percent' column to 'percent_female' and 'group' to 'age_group' and 'Year' to 'year' for clarity and consistency in earnings_female.csv
earnings_female <- earnings_female %>%
  rename(percent_female = percent, age_group = group, year=Year)

# Relabel 'Total, 16 years and older' to 'Total' in 'age_group' column. Remove anytime 'years' appears in age_group column and relabel '65 years and older' to '65+'
earnings_female <- earnings_female %>%
  mutate(age_group = gsub("Total, 16 years and older", "Total", age_group)) %>%
  mutate(age_group = gsub(" years", "", age_group)) %>%
  mutate(age_group = gsub("65 and older", "65+", age_group))

# Subset employed_gender.csv from 1979 to 2011 to match the time frame from the earnings_female.csv dataset
employed_gender <- employed_gender %>%
  filter(year >= 1979, year <= 2011)

# Merge two datasets by year
combined_data <- earnings_female %>%
  inner_join(employed_gender, by = "year")

# Keep only part-time % columns since the full-time % columns are redundant: full-time % = 100% - part-time. The data does not contain percentage unemployed
clean_data <- combined_data %>%
  select(year, age_group, percent_female, total_part_time, part_time_female, part_time_male) 

# View clean_data
head(clean_data)
```

```{r}
# Create line plot of female percentage of male salary over time, faceted by age group
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = year, y = percent_female,color = age_group, group = age_group)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Female salary % of male salary from 1979-2011",
    subtitle = "Women 34+ years of age have lower female salary % of male salary than other age groups",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Female salary % of male salary",
    caption = "Source: TidyTuesday 2019 'Women in the Workforce' github repository"
  ) +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Age Group") +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~age_group, scales = "free_y")
```
