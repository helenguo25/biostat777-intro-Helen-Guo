Claudia Goldin’s work suggests that the gender wage gap has experienced a large convergence toward equality in the last century, but difficulties for women returning to work after having children may result in reduced work in middle age (Goldin 2014). What do the data show?\n\n# Create line plot of female percentage of male salary over time, faceted by age group\nggplot(clean_data, aes(x = year, y = percent_female,color = age_group, group = age_group)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Female salary % of male salary from 1979-2011\",\n    subtitle = \"Women 34+ years of age have lower female salary % of male salary than other age groups\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Female salary % of male salary\",\n    caption = \"Source: TidyTuesday 2019 'Women in the Workforce' GitHub repository\"\n  ) +\n  scale_color_discrete(name = \"Age Group\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  facet_wrap(~age_group, scales = \"free_y\")\n\n\n\n\nOverall, female salary percentage of male salary has risen over the years, from &lt;65% to &gt;80% between 1979 and 2011. But we can see that even by 2011, female salary percentage of male salary drops from &gt;90% to &lt;80% after 35 years of age. The data supports the idea that women experience a greater gender wage gap in the middle age and beyond.\nResearch from the Pew Research Center, shown on the left, supports the ideas conveyed above as well (Kochhar 2023).\n\n\n\nSource: (Kochhar 2023)\n\n\nNow let’s take a look at percentage of part-time working females and males over time.\n\n# Subset to all ages combined\nclean_data_total &lt;- clean_data %&gt;%\n  filter(age_group == \"Total\")\n\n\n\nWe cannot stratify results by age groups, since the TidyTuesday data only contain percentage of part-time work females by year.\n\n# Create scatter plot with regression line of percentage of part-time working females over time\nggplot(clean_data_total, aes(x = year, y = part_time_female)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = 'y~x') + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Percentage of part-time working females from 1979-2011\",\n    subtitle = \"Percentage of part-time working females only decreased slightly over time\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"% part-time working females\",\n    caption = \"Source: TidyTuesday 2019 'Women in the Workforce' GitHub repository\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() \n\n\n\n# Create line plot of percentage of part-time working males over time\nggplot(clean_data_total, aes(x = year, y = part_time_male)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = 'y~x') + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Percentage part-time working males from 1979-2011\",\n    subtitle = \"Percentage of part-time working males increased slightly over time\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"% part-time working males\",\n    caption = \"Source: TidyTuesday 2019 'Women in the Workforce' GitHub repository\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nThe regression line shows that percentage of part-time working females fluctuated from 1979 to 2011, but decreased only slightly (by 1 percentage point). Percentage of part-time working males from 1979 to 2011 only increased by 2 percentage points. These mild results hint that the reduction of the gender wage gap that occurred during this time span may not be explained by changes in part-time work patterns, but rather other societal and lifestyle factors. In fact, Claudia Goldin’s work points to part-time work as one of the persisting contributors to the remaining wage gap (Goldin 2015).\n\n\n\nIn summary, the gender wage gap greatly reduced between 1979 to 2011 from &lt;65% to &gt;80%. But female salary percentage of male salary drops from &gt;90% to &lt;80% after 35 years of age. Percentage of part-time working females only decreased by 1 percentage point and percentage part-time working males only increased by 2 percentage points between 1979 to 2011. Perhaps more nuanced historical data on other factors such as employer bias would benefit this analysis by providing a clearer picture for the reasons behind the reduction of the gender wage gap.\n\n\n\ndplyr functions: ‘rename’, ‘mutate’, ‘filter’, ‘inner_join’, and ‘select’\nggplot2 geom_* functions: geom_line, geom_point, geom_smooth"
